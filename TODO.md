# TODO for Supabot

Urgent

-   leader pathfinding

Medium priority

-   detect naval map (can scan tiles to check if more of the map is water or not)
-   handle naval construction
-   detect islands and implement island-hopping

Not urgent

-   Remove squad paradigm, all unit-related for mission can just go into the mission.
