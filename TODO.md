# TODO for Supabot

Urgent

-   remove lodash usage
-   make scouts more resilient, i.e. bot doesn't become idle if it can't find your base after 5 attempts
-   maybe not spam move commands for scouting and attacking missions
-   don't spam repair
-   handle multiple opponents or allies
-   leader pathfinding

Medium priority

-   detect naval map (can scan tiles to check if more of the map is water or not)
-   handle naval construction
-   detect islands and implement island-hopping

Not urgent

-   Remove squad paradigm, all unit-related for mission can just go into the mission.
